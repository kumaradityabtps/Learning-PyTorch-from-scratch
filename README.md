# Learning-PyTorch-from-scratch
In this repo , I will dump all the code and notes and project, which I make while learning PyTorch

# Day-1 :- 
Studied the basics like Intro to Deep Learning, ML vs DL , introduction to PyTorch and its use in Fcailiating deep learning algorithms.
And Did setup in Colab For PyTorch.

Practical-
   * Intro To Tensors
   * Creating Random Tensors
   * Creating Tensors with Zeros And Ones in PyTorch
   * Creating a Tensor Range and Tensors Like Other

# Day-2 :-
Today , I concentrated more on tensors , and tried to understand the Data Types and some operations using PyTorch. 
Also had to enhance the setup, but finally moved to Google Colab-Research

Practical Topics Covered-
   * Tensor - Data types, and manipulation
   * Precision ( Comp. science)
   * Creating random tensors
   * Finding Out details about some tensors
   * mathematical operations on tensors
   * Creating tensor and addition
   * multiplication
   * substarction
   * In-Built PyTorch Functions- add and multiply

# Day-3 :-
Did a deep dive into Matrix concepts, and solved some theoretical questions for brush up and, then hands-on PyTorch code.

Practical-
   * Element-wise & Matrix multiplication
   * time comaprision of the "for loop" & "torch.matmul"
   * different kind of errors like shape error etc.
   * matrix transpose

# Day-4 :-
After along break, resatarted studying pytorch and covered the more mathe mathtical and practical concepts.

Practical-
   * Finding min, max, mean, sum etc.
   * Reshaping, Stacking, Squeezing, and unsqueezing
   * Indexing
   * Finding positional min and max
