# Learning-PyTorch-from-scratch
In this repo , I will dump all the code and notes and project, which I make while learning PyTorch

# Day-1 :- 
Studied the basics like Intro to Deep Learning, ML vs DL , introduction to PyTorch and its use in Fcailiating deep learning algorithms.
And Did setup in Colab For PyTorch.

Practical-
   * Intro To Tensors
   * Creating Random Tensors
   * Creating Tensors with Zeros And Ones in PyTorch
   * Creating a Tensor Range and Tensors Like Other

# Day-2 :-
Today , I concentrated more on tensors , and tried to understand the Data Types and some operations using PyTorch. 
Also had to enhance the setup, but finally moved to Google Colab-Research

Practical Topics Covered-
   * Tensor - Data types, and manipulation
   * Precision ( Comp. science)
   * Creating random tensors
   * Finding Out details about some tensors
   * mathematical operations on tensors
   * Creating tensor and addition
   * multiplication
   * substarction
   * In-Built PyTorch Functions- add and multiply

# Day-3 :-
Did a deep dive into Matrix concepts, and solved some theoretical questions for brush up and, then hands-on PyTorch code.

Practical-
   * Element-wise & Matrix multiplication
   * time comaprision of the "for loop" & "torch.matmul"
   * different kind of errors like shape error etc.
   * matrix transpose

# Day-4 :-
After along break, resatarted studying pytorch and covered the more mathe mathtical and practical concepts.

Practical-
   * Finding min, max, mean, sum etc.
   * Reshaping, Stacking, Squeezing, and unsqueezing
   * Indexing
   * Finding positional min and max

# Day-5 :-
Today was more conceptual, then practicals. Studied the usability and applications ofthe ML concepts.

Practical-
   * PyTorch tensors & Numpy
   * Numpy array to tensor
   * tensor to numpy array
   * Reproducability
   * Running Tensors and PyTorch objects on GPUs,
   * Putting tensors (and models) on the GPU

# Day-6 :-
Day-6 is the combination of both saturday & sunday, did model deployment as well as the hands-on practice of previous topics

Practical-
   * Data Preparation for building regresssion model.
   * Building functions to visualise data.
   * Building first pytorch model
Hands-on Exercise -
   * Creating tensors (empty, type, zeros, ones, rand, tensors, arange)
   * Tensor Shapes
   * Tensor Data Type
   * MatheMatical Operations

# Day-7 :-
It was already, day-7 so I tried to do some advanced level of programming, "Autograd"
    
Topics covered-
   * Mathematics behind the Deep Learning concepts
   * Need for AutoGrad
   * Use of autograd for different applications
