# Learning-PyTorch-from-scratch
In this repo , I will dump all the code and notes and project, which I make while learning PyTorch

# Day-1 :- 
Studied the basics like Intro to Deep Learning, ML vs DL , introduction to PyTorch and its use in Fcailiating deep learning algorithms.
And Did setup in Colab For PyTorch.

Practical-
   * Intro To Tensors
   * Creating Random Tensors
   * Creating Tensors with Zeros And Ones in PyTorch
   * Creating a Tensor Range and Tensors Like Other

# Day-2 :-

Practical-
   * test1
   * test2
   * test3

# day-3 :-

Practical-
   * test1
